# Neuron

A basic Markdown note taker / text editor based on python.

> PS the name is just random AF, nothing to do with any features i plan to implement, I just felt like naming it this

## To do

- Text editor widget
- Display Widget ( displaying markdown formatted)
- PDF export
- HTML Export (control style with CSS)
- Save and load MD files locally
- Connect to google drive (maybe more cloud providers later if i feel like it)
- Tree view of files in the notes folder
- Maybe customizable themes
